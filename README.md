#### [Guess The Song](https://github.com/swilliams186/gts-python-spotify) - 
A project made as a proof of concept. A take on the popular "Guess the Song" game where a small sample of a song is played and then the user has to guess the name of the song and the artist. My app uses the Spotify API to access their immense database of songs and play a short sample of a track. The idea for this came to me after a new years eve party where the host was using pre-generated YouTube videos for the song playlists. I thought that was a horrible way of doing it so I created my own game.
###### I also learnt an excellent lesson here about uploading files containing client secrets! I now use external files and .gitignore or environment variables every time. A mistake everyone makes once!
